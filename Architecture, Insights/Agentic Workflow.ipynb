    "- LLMs are called sequentially.\n",
    "- Each step uses the output from the previous as input.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    - Step 1: Summarize a document.\n",
    "    - Step 2: Extract entities from the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Parallelization\n",
    "- Input is processed simultaneously by multiple LLM instances.\n",
    "- Each LLM task is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    - Given an article, generate summary, sentiment, and questions in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔑 Key Insight:**\n",
    "- LLMs are used like functions \n",
    "- the logic is entirely controlled by predefined code, not the model."

    "- One LLM (the orchestrator) splits tasks and delegates to worker LLMs.\n",
    "- A synthesizer might merge their outputs.\n",

    "- **Example:**\n",

    "- Generator creates outputs, Evaluator scores them, and feedback loops improve the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be seen as self-critique or reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    - Generate multiple answers → score them → choose best or retry generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚦 Routing\n",
    "- A Router LLM decides which of several paths/tools should process the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - User query → Router chooses sentiment analysis vs summarization vs translation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔑 Key Insight:** LLMs start to play a meta-role – they decide how to use other LLMs or tools, though still within a fixed structure."
